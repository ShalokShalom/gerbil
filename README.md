# Gerbil üêπ

Gerbil is a "dynamic website generator", written in [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).
It is meant to provide many of the conveniences of static website generators
(ease of content creation, deploying, and maintenance), but to also provide a
customizable backend for dynamic features such as hosting user comments.

The Gerbil binary can be used to scaffold and serve a site without writing Nim
code, or the Gerbil library can be imported to create a customized backend.

**Note**: This is a new project and is still heavily in development.

## Demo and Documentation

The documentation is [here](https://getgerbil.com), and is composed and hosted
as a Gerbil site (to demo how Gerbil works). The source of the site is in this
repository.
