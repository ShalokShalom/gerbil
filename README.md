# Gerbil :hampster:

Gerbil is a "dynamic website generator", written in Nim. It is meant to provide
many of the conveniences of static website generators (ease of content creation,
deploying, and maintenance), but to also provide a customizable backend for
dynamic features such as hosting user comments.

The Gerbil binary can be used to scaffold and serve a site without writing Nim
code, or the Gerbil library can be imported to create a customized backend.
