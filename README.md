# Gerbil: A dynamic site generator 🐹

Gerbil is a library and binary, written in Nim, that helps developers scaffold and serve dynamic websites.

## Goals

**CLI** Create topics and content faster by running CLI scaffolding commands  
**Build content for fast loading** The markdown content are built into HTML in advance to help pages load faster.  
**Templating system** A templating system is used so that the site template can be easily changed without a rebuild  
**Articles** Create topics and publish articles under those topics  
**Comments** Moderate and publish anonymous comments using an included backend.  
**Backend code** Customize the backend by using the Gerbil library instead of the prebuilt binary
