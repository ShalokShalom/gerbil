# Tags for articles

After writing a piece of content, you might want to help organize it under
one or more _tags_.

In the [meta.json file for an article](https://github.com/jasonprogrammer/gerbil/blob/master/site/pods/tutorials/content/uujjkdd9/meta.json#L5),
you can add tags. When you build the site, a [tags.html](https://github.com/jasonprogrammer/gerbil/blob/master/site/pods/tutorials/tags.html)
file will be generated.

These links can then be viewed [on the tags page](/c/tutorials/tags).
