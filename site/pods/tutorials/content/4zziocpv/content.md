# Customizable mustache templates for pages

There is a **web/templates** directory that contains HTML templates for the
site.

The **site.html** is the default outer template for all pages, but this can be
overridden for other types of pages simply by creating one of the following
files:

- home.html: A template used for the home page only
- page.html: A template used for "pages" (these differ from articles)
- 404.html: A template used to display a custom 404 page
