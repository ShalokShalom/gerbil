# Header links

Gerbil creates markup for each header in your article, so that it is easy for
users to link to sections of your articles. If you
**click on the header below**, the URL should change and your browser should
"jump" to the header.

## Go ahead, click me

Click the header above and watch the URL change. For longer articles, the
"jump" effect will probably be more noticeable.
