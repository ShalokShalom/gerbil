# Writing articles in Commonmark and HTML

<div style="color: #383838">June 12, 2020</div>

Articles may be written in [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) Markdown, and
HTML may be embedded when needed. The date above, in gray text, is written
using a **\<div\>** in HTML to demonstrate HTML embedding.

This markdown support in Gerbil is provided by
[this Nim markdown package](https://github.com/soasme/nim-markdown).
