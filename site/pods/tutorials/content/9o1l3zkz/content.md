# Embedding one piece of content into another

If you're writing a series of articles, and you want to provide links to each
article in the series at the bottom of each content page, doing this manually
would be time-consuming. There is a tag, however, that can be used to embed
once piece of content into another piece. It looks like this:

```
<gerbilcontent pod="tutorials" id="wrrrn9zw"/>
```

## Embedding example

Let's create [a sample piece of content to embed](), and embed it below as an
example. You should see a list of links below:

<gerbilcontent pod="tutorials" id="wrrrn9zw"/>
