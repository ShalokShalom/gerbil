<h1>Here is a sample &quot;root page&quot;</h1>
<p>This documentation page was created by creating the following file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;SITE_DIR&gt;/pages/sample-root-page.md
</code></pre>
<p>When the site is built, this file is read, and a <strong>sample-root-page.html</strong>
file is created. The URL to the page (notice the URL for this page) is
determined by the name of the file (a &quot;slug&quot;), which should only contain
numbers, letters, or a dash.</p>
<p>These pages differ from content/article pages in that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The URL is at the site root</li>
<li>There is no static/ directory for the specific root page</li>
<li>The comment submission form is not included at the bottom</li>
</ul>
