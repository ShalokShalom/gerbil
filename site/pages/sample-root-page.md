# Here is a sample "root page"

This documentation page was created by creating the following file:

```
<SITE_DIR>/pages/sample-root-page.md
```

When the site is built, this file is read, and a **sample-root-page.html**
file is created. The URL to the page (notice the URL for this page) is
determined by the name of the file (a "slug"), which should only contain
numbers, letters, or a dash.

These pages differ from content/article pages in that:

- The URL is at the site root
- There is no static/ directory for the specific root page
- The comment submission form is not included at the bottom
