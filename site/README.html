# The site directory

This directory contains content (Markdown) files for the site, as well as
site-specific configuration.

The contents include:

- pods: A "pod" is a topic that will appear on the site. Pieces of content
  (articles) are organized by topic.
- pages: A "page" is a Markdown file that gets built to HTML and is mapped to a
  route at the root of the website. It is not associated with a topic and does
  not have comments associated with it. An example of a page is a "contact me"
  page.
- comment-review: This directory stores files that help moderate comments.
- spam_questions: This directory stores spam-prevention questions for humans to
  answer.
- site.json: Site-specific configuration
- secrets.json: Contains secrets used to encrypt answers to spam-prevention
  questions (so that the encrypted answer can be returned to us, along with
  the answer the user submits), and comment-moderator login credentials.
