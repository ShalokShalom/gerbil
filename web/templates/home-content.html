<h2>What is Gerbil?</h2>

Gerbil is a "dynamic site generator", written in
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. It is meant to provide many of the
conveniences of static site generators (ease of content creation, deploying, and
maintenance), but to also provide a customizable backend for dynamic features
such as hosting user comments.

<br><br>

The Gerbil binary can be used to scaffold and serve a site without writing Nim
code, or the Gerbil library can be imported and customized.
