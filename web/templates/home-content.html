<h2>Introduction</h2>

Gerbil is a "dynamic website generator", written in
<a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>. It is meant to provide many of the
conveniences of static site generators (ease of content creation, deploying, and
maintenance), but to also provide a customizable backend for dynamic features
such as hosting user comments. It is flat-file based (no database used) by
design.

<br><br>

The Gerbil binary can be used to scaffold and serve a site without writing Nim
code, or the Gerbil library can be imported and customized.

<br><br>

<b>Note</b>: This is a new project and is still heavily in development.

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Why is it named Gerbil?</h3>

As pets, gerbils are:

<ul>
  <li>Inexpensive</li>
  <li>Easy to maintain</li>
  <li>Lighweight</li>
  <li>Fast</li>
</ul>

Those are goals of this project. Also, the name was short and didn't seem to be
used anywhere else. ðŸ˜‰
